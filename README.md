# ENGG-680-Final-Project (Group 19)
In this repository, we have added our final project (ENGG 680) ML-based analysis codes (sequentially). In this project, we've predicted the flexural strength of fiberized concrete.Â  We have utilized every type of fiber that is currently accessible. This project encompasses 5 ML models, such as LR, SVR, RF, XGB, and LGBM. XGB yields a noteworthy result. We evaluate the models' performance using metrics such as R2, Adj. R2, RMSE, and MAE. Moreover, the SHAP plot and feature importance are also performed to demonstrate the result. Overall, this project has produced a noteworthy and innovative result that will greatly benefit future researchers.
